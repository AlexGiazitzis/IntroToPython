# one list in the variable
# == 1-Dimensional list
List1d = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# two lists in the variable
# one external, others nested.
# == 2-Dimensional List
List2d = [[1, 2, 3], \
          [4, 5, 6]]

# Similarly, nesting lists
# inside nested lists
# can lead to N-Dimensional
# lists. Like the following
# 3-D list
List3d = [[[1, 2, 3], \
           [4, 5, 6]], \
          [[7, 8, 9], \
           [10, 11, 12]]]
